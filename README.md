- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @StephanieTayo
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Software Development. I try to post my projects as i continue to develop my skills and learn.  
- Strong expertise in data validation and analysis through both front-end and back-end components, and a history of implementing successful projects using Java  SpringBoot, JavaScript (React, Vue, Ang), Python, MS SQL, MySQL, Git, VS Code, and AWS.

- I have a proven track record of implementing successful projects. In addition, my unique background as an artist (Artbytayo.com) with strong creative abilities sets me apart as I bring a fresh perspective to problem-solving, as well as my experience collaborating with diverse technical and cross-functional teams to achieve outstanding results.
